                <ab>On this day God sent Michael to Samuel the prophet whilst he was in the
                    sanctuary, and commanded him to go to the house of Jesse, the father of David, in
                    Bethlehem to anoint his son David king over the children of Israel. And Samuel went to
                    Jesse, and he said unto him, “Bring hither all thy sons”: and Jesse brought them [all] with
                    the exception of David, who was tending the sheep in the fields. When Samuel raised the
                    horn of oil of kings over the heads of the sons of Jesse, [he saw that] God was not pleased
                    with them. And Samuel said unto Jesse, “Doth there not remain unto thee some other
                    son?” And Jesse said unto him, “There remaineth the youth, the youngest of them, who is
                    herding the sheep in the fields.” And Samuel said unto him, “Bring him hither”; and Jesse
                    brought him. And straightway Samuel took up the horn of oil of kings, and anointed him,
                    and God was pleased with him, and he reigned over the children of Israel. And on this day
                    also God sent Saint Michael the archangel to David the prophet, and he helped him and
                    gave him strength to slay Goliath, the giant of the Philistines, and deliver the children of
                    Israel. For this reason the doctors of the Church have commanded and ordained that the
                    people shall keep a festival in honor of Saint Michael on the (twenty-second?) day of this
                    month. Salutation to Saint Michael</ab></div>
